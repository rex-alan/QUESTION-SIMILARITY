# Question Similarity Measurement using Jaccard Similarity

In school exams, college semesters, entrance tests, and interviews, similar questions often repeat. This project aims to measure the similarity between two sentences or questions using the Jaccard similarity metric. It leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and analysis.

## Overview

This program calculates the Jaccard similarity between two sentences or questions to determine if they are similar or dissimilar. Jaccard similarity is computed based on the intersection and union of the sets of words (after removing stopwords) in the two sentences.

## Key Features

- Calculates Jaccard similarity to quantify question similarity.
- Uses NLTK for efficient text processing, including tokenization and stopwords removal.
- Provides an intuitive approach to comparing pairs of sentences or questions.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
